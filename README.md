# ðŸ“¡ Distance Vector Routing Simulator

A Python implementation of the **Distance Vector Routing Algorithm**, used in network routing protocols like RIP. This simulator reads a list of routers, connections, and dynamic updates â€” then computes and displays routing tables and distance snapshots over multiple iterations.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Simulates **Distance Vector routing updates**
- Displays distance tables at each time step
- Handles **dynamic updates**: adding, removing, or modifying link costs
- Supports custom network topologies via text input
- Simple, readable terminal-based output
- No external dependencies â€” pure Python 3
